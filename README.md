# Genetools

## Description

Genetools is a web app that allows users to analyze genetic data. The interface allows the input of a DNA sequence and returns the corresponding RNA sequence, amino acid sequence, and codon usage, in addition to a widget showing GC content of the original DNA sequence.

This was put together as a final project for COMPSCI 426 at UMass Amherst, and since I haven't run it since the end of that class, I'm not sure if the Docker setup still runs okay - I'll try to give it a shot sometime soon.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <genetools>
   ```

## Usage

1. Build the Docker images and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
